## Development environment setup

* Use one of the Python versions listed in `.python-version`. I use `pyenv` as
  the Python version manager, and v3.10.0b2 as the Python version.
* Create a virtual environment, and link it to the code editor you're using. I
  use Intellij / PyCharm.
* Once you have it activated, you can run all the unit tests with
  `python3 -m unittest discover tests`
